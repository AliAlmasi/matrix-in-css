# Matrix in CSS

For compiling `index.pug` file, I used the `pug-cli` way (compiling locally on my machine).

You can install `pug-cli` on your machine using `npm` by running:

```bash
$ sudo npm i pug-cli -g
```

And use the following command for compiling:

```bash
$ pug index.pug
```

which will result of an `index.html` file being created.

Also, for compiling `style.scss` I installed `sass` locally (as said in their official docs, _Install Everywhere_).

You can install `sass`, again with `npm`, by running:

```bash
$ sudo npm i sass -g
```

And use the following command for compiling:

```bash
$ sass style.scss style.css
```
